## Introduction

This document details a modular, industry-standard design and testing process for SnapFox, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and reusability. The approach is based on separation of concerns, component-based architecture, interface contracts, and test-driven development (TDD). Each SRS requirement is mapped to specific modules and tested at multiple levels.

---

## 1. Modular Architecture Overview

SnapFox is structured as a set of independent, reusable modules, each with a clear responsibility and well-defined interfaces. This enables parallel development, easier testing, and future extensibility.

### 1.1 Core Modules

- **Capture Module**: Handles all screenshot capture modes (full page, viewport, DOM element, free-form).
- **Editor Module**: Provides the canvas workspace, annotation tools, and editing logic.
- **Clipboard Module**: Manages copying images to the clipboard and permission handling.
- **Sharing Module**: Integrates with Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Web Share APIs.
- **UI Module**: Manages the toolbar, sidebar, popups, and user interactions.
- **State Management Module**: Centralizes undo/redo, action history, and state transitions.
- **Accessibility Module**: Ensures all UI elements are accessible and standards-compliant.
- **Integration Module**: Interfaces with Firefox WebExtension APIs and external services.

### 1.2 Module Responsibilities & Interfaces

Each module exposes a clear API (interface contract) and communicates with others via events or service calls. For example:
- The UI Module triggers the Capture Module and receives image data.
- The Editor Module exposes methods for adding annotations, shapes, and text.
- The State Management Module provides undo/redo APIs consumed by the Editor and UI.

## 2. Industry-Standard Design Process

### 2.1 Requirements Analysis
- Map each SRS requirement to one or more modules.
- Define acceptance criteria for each requirement.

### 2.2 Component-Based Design
- Decompose the system into loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules.
- Define interfaces and data contracts (TypeScript interfaces, API schemas).
- Use design patterns (e.g., Command for undo/redo, Observer for UI updates).

### 2.3 Prototyping & Wireframing
- Create wireframes for toolbar, sidebar, and editor UI.
- Prototype key interactions and flows.

### 2.4 Interface Definition
- Document module APIs and expected behaviors.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and interface enforcement.

### 2.5 Implementation Planning
- Prioritize modules based on dependencies (e.g., Capture before Editor).
- Plan for parallel development where possible.

### 2.6 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write unit tests for each module before implementation.
- Define integration and system tests for cross-module flows.

### 2.7 Code Review & Continuous Integration
- Enforce code quality with ESLint/Prettier and automated CI checks.
- Peer review all code and documentation.

## 3. Mapping SRS Requirements to Modules

| SRS Requirement | Module(s) Responsible |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| FR-1            | Capture, UI          |
| FR-2            | Editor, UI           |
| FR-3            | Editor               |
| FR-4            | Editor               |
| FR-5            | State Management, Editor |
| FR-6            | Clipboard            |
| FR-7            | Sharing              |
| FR-8            | Clipboard            |
| FR-9            | UI                   |
| FR-10           | UI                   |
| NFR-1           | All (esp. Capture, Editor) |
| NFR-2           | UI, Editor           |
| NFR-3           | All                  |
| NFR-4           | All                  |
| NFR-5           | Integration, All     |
| NFR-6           | All                  |
| NFR-7           | Accessibility, UI    |

## 4. Modular Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Each module is tested in isolation using mocks/stubs for dependencies.
- 100% coverage for core logic (capture, annotation, undo/redo, sharing).

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between modules (e.g., UI triggers capture, editor loads image).
- Simulate real user flows and edge cases.

### 4.3 System Testing
- End-to-end tests covering the full workflow (capture → edit → share/copy).
- Performance, reliability, and accessibility tests.

### 4.4 Regression & Acceptance Testing
- Automated regression suite for all features.
- User acceptance testing with real users and feedback loops.

---

## 5. Review, Iteration, and Documentation

- Regular design and code reviews for all modules.
- Iterative improvements based on test results and user feedback.
- Update module documentation and interface contracts after each major change.

---

## 6. Traceability & Compliance

- Maintain a traceability matrix mapping SRS requirements to modules and tests.
- Ensure all Mozilla Add-ons and WCAG 2.1 AA standards are met.

---

## 7. Future-Proofing

- Design modules for extensibility (e.g., plugin system for annotation tools).
- Use WebExtension standards for portability to other browsers.

This modular, industry-standard approach ensures SnapFox is robust, maintainable, and ready for future growth.
