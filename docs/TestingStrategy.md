## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for SnapFox, leveraging `pytest` as the primary testing framework. The strategy covers unit, integration, and system testing, ensuring all modules are robust, reliable, and maintainable. The approach aligns with industry best practices and supports continuous integration (CI) for ongoing code quality.

## 1. Test Organization

- **Test Directory Structure:**
  - All tests are placed in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the source module structure.
  - Each module (e.g., Capture, Editor, Clipboard) has a corresponding test file or subdirectory.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Test files: `test_<module>.py`
  - Test functions: `test_<functionality>()`
- **Fixtures:**
  - Use `pytest` fixtures for setup/teardown of test environments and reusable test data.

## 2. Types of Tests

### 2.1 Unit Tests
- **Purpose:** Test individual functions, classes, or methods in isolation.
- **Tools:** `pytest`, with mocks/stubs for dependencies (e.g., `unittest.mock`).
- **Scope:** Each module (Capture, Editor, Clipboard, etc.) has dedicated unit tests.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Aim for high coverage of core logic.
  - Test edge cases and error handling.

### 2.2 Integration Tests
- **Purpose:** Test interactions between multiple modules or components.
- **Tools:** `pytest`, with real or mocked dependencies as appropriate.
- **Scope:**
  - Test flows such as capture → edit, edit → copy/share, etc.
  - Simulate user actions and data passing between modules.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use fixtures to simulate real-world scenarios.
  - Validate data integrity and correct module communication.

### 2.3 System (End-to-End) Tests
- **Purpose:** Test the complete workflow from user action to final output.
- **Tools:**
  - `pytest` for backend/system logic.
  - UI automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) for browser-based flows.
- **Scope:**
  - Full workflow: capture → edit → copy/share.
  - Performance, reliability, and accessibility checks.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Automate critical user journeys.
  - Include regression tests for major features.

### 2.4 Additional Test Types
- **Performance Tests:** Measure time from capture to preview, memory usage, etc.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Use tools like axe or Lighthouse for UI accessibility.
- **Security Tests:** Ensure no data leaks, permissions are respected, and all processing is local.

## 3. Mapping Tests to Modules

| Module         | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | System Tests |
|----------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Capture        | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| Editor         | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| Clipboard      | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| Sharing        | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| UI             | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| State Mgmt     | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| Accessibility  | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |
| Integration    | Yes        | Yes              | Yes          |

## 4. Continuous Integration & Code Quality

- **CI Pipeline:**
  - All tests are run automatically on each commit/pull request using a CI service (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
  - Linting (ESLint/Prettier for JS/TS, flake8/black for Python scripts) is enforced.
  - Test coverage reports are generated and monitored.
- **Code Reviews:**
  - All code and tests are peer-reviewed before merging.
- **Documentation:**
  - Tests are documented and updated alongside code changes.

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside implementation (TDD where feasible).
- Use descriptive test names and clear assertions.
- Keep tests fast, isolated, and repeatable.
- Mock external dependencies and APIs.
- Regularly review and refactor tests for clarity and coverage.

## 6. Wrapping Up

This testing strategy ensures SnapFox is reliable, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements. By combining modular unit tests, robust integration and system tests, and continuous integration, the project maintains high code quality and user trust.
